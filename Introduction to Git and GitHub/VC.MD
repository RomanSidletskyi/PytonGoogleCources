``diff`` is used to find differences between two files. On its own, itâ€™s a bit hard to use; instead, use it with diff -u to find lines which differ in two files:

``diff -u`` is used to compare two files, line by line, and have the differing lines compared side-by-side in the same output. See below:

There are some other interesting patch and diff commands such as patch -p1, diff -r !

``Patch`` is useful for applying file differences. See the below example, which compares two files. The comparison is saved as a .diff file, which is then patched to the original file!

**.gitignore files**
.gitignore files are used to tell the git tool to intentionally ignore some files in a given Git repository. For example, this can be useful for configuration files or metadata files that a user may not want to check into the master branch. Check out more at: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore.
