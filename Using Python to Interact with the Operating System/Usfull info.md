## More About Input Functions
Python 2 and Python 3 handle input and raw_input differently.

In Python 2

- input(x) is roughly the same as eval(raw_input(x))

- raw_input() is preferred, unless the author wants to support evaluating string expressions.

- eval() is used to evaluate string expressions.

Standard Library Docs:

- https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#input

- https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#raw_input

- https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#eval

In Python 3

- Input handles string as a generic string. It does not evaluate the string as a string expression.

- raw_input doesnâ€™t exist, but with some tricky techniques, it can be supported.

- eval() can be used the same as Python 2.
