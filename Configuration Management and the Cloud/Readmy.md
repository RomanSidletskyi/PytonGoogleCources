## Welcome to the Course
Welcome to the course!
In this course, you’ll learn how to automate managing large fleets of computers using tools like Configuration Management. You'll also learn how you can make use of Cloud technologies

Course prerequisites
This course requires some familiarity with basic IT concepts like operating with file systems, handling processes, and understanding log files.

The example scripts and programs in this course are written in Python, so you’ll need an understanding of this programming language, too. 

We also touch upon other concepts covered in other courses of the specialization, like using a Version Control System, or using the Linux command line interface.

How to pass the class
The course certificate gives you a way to prove your new programming skills to employers. To qualify for the certificate, you have to enroll in the program, pay the fee, and pass the graded assessments. If you don’t want to pay, you can still audit the course for free. This lets you view all videos and submit practice quizzes as you learn. One thing to remember though is that this option doesn’t let you submit assessments, earn a grade, or receive the certificate.

How deadlines work
When you enroll in the course, the system automatically sets a deadline for when you need to complete each section. Heads up: These deadlines are there to help you organize your time, but you can take the course at your own pace. If you "miss" a deadline, you can just reset it to a new date. There’s no time limit in which you have to finish the course, and you can earn the certificate whenever you finish.

Qwiklabs
For some of our exercises, you'll be using an application called Qwiklabs. Qwiklabs lets you interact with a computer running an operating system that might not be the same one running on your machine. The Qwiklabs scenarios will allow you to solve some real-world problems, putting your knowledge to work through active learning exercises.

Getting and giving help
Here are a few ways you can give and get help: 

1. Discussion forums: You can share information and ideas with your fellow learners in the discussion forums. These are also great places to find answers to questions you may have. If you're stuck on a concept, are struggling to solve a practice exercise, or you just want more information on a subject, the discussion forums are there to help you move forward.
2. Coursera learner support: Use the [Learner Help Center](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us) to find information on specific technical issues. These include error messages, difficulty submitting assignments, or problems with video playback. If you can’t find an answer in the documentation, you can also report your problem to the Coursera support team by clicking on the Contact Us! link available at the bottom of help center articles.
3. Qwiklabs support: Please use the [Qwiklabs support request](https://qwiklab.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) form to report any issues with accessing or using Qwiklabs. A member of the Qwiklabs team will work with you to help resolve the problem.
4. Course content issues: You can also flag problems in course materials by rating them. When you rate course materials, the instructor will see your ratings and feedback; other learners won’t. To rate course materials:

- Open the course material you want to rate. You can only rate videos, readings, and quizzes.
- If the content was interesting or helped you learn, click the thumbs-up icon.
- If the content was unhelpful or confusing, click the thumbs-down icon.

### Finding out more information
Throughout this course, we teach you how to solve a wide range of technical issues. While we’ll provide a lot of information through videos and supplemental readings, sometimes, you may need to look things up on your own (now and throughout your career). Things change fast in IT, so it’s critical to do your own research to stay up-to-date on what’s new. We recommend you use your favorite search engine to find more information about concepts we cover in this course — it’s great practice for the real world!

### Managing VMs in GCP
Over the last few videos we learned how to create and use virtual machines running on GCP. We then explored how we can use one VM as a template for creating many more VMs with the same setup. You can find a lot more information about this in the following tutorials:

- https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart-linux
- https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-vm-from-instance-template
- https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs
