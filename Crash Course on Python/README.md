Finding out more information
Throughout this course, we'll be teaching you the basics of programming and automation. We'll provide a lot of information through videos and supplemental readings. But sometimes, you may also need to look things up on your own, now and throughout your career. Things change fast in IT, so it’s critical to do your own research so you stay up-to-date on what’s new. We recommend you use your favorite search engine to find additional information— it’s great practice for the real world!

On top of search results, here are some good programming resources available online:

The official [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). This tutorial is designed to help people teach themselves Python. While it goes in a different order than the one we're taking here, it covers a lot of the same subjects that we explore in this course. You can refer to this resource for extra information on these subjects.

The [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/) book. This book aims to teach people how to program in Python. It's available online in PDF and browsable forms. Again, you can use this resource to learn more about some of the subjects we cover.

The [official language reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html). This is a technical reference of all Python language components. At first, this resource might be a little too complex, but as you learn how Python works and how it’s built, this can be a useful reference to understand the details of these interactions.

# Using Python on your own
The best way to learn any programming language is to practice it on your own as much as you can. If you have Python installed on your computer, you can execute the interpreter by running the python3 command (or just python on Windows), and you can close it by typing exit() or Ctrl-D.

If you don’t already have Python installed on your machine, that’s alright. We’ll explain how to install it in an upcoming course.

In the meantime, you can still practice by using one of the many online Python interpreters or codepads available online. There’s not much difference between an interpreter and a codepad. An interpreter is more interactive than a codepad, but they both let you execute code and see the results.

Below, you’ll find links to some of the most popular online interpreters and codepads. Give them a go to find your favorite.

Additional Python resources
While this course will give you information about how Python works and how to write scripts in Python, you’ll likely want to find out more about specific parts of the language. Here are some great ways to help you find additional info: 

Read the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).

Search for answers or ask a question on [Stack Overflow.](https://stackoverflow.com/) 

Subscribe to the Python [tutor](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor) mailing list, where you can ask questions and collaborate with other Python learners.

Subscribe to the [Python-announce](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-announce-list) mailing list to read about the latest updates in the language.

Python history and current status
Python was released almost 30 years ago and has a rich history. You can read more about it on the [History of Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python) Wikipedia page or in the section on the [history of the software](https://docs.python.org/3.0/license.html) from the official Python documentation.

Python has recently been called the fastest growing programming language. If you're interested in why this is and how it’s measured, you can find out more in these articles:
