Finding out more information
Throughout this course, we'll be teaching you the basics of programming and automation. We'll provide a lot of information through videos and supplemental readings. But sometimes, you may also need to look things up on your own, now and throughout your career. Things change fast in IT, so it’s critical to do your own research so you stay up-to-date on what’s new. We recommend you use your favorite search engine to find additional information— it’s great practice for the real world!

On top of search results, here are some good programming resources available online:

The official [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). This tutorial is designed to help people teach themselves Python. While it goes in a different order than the one we're taking here, it covers a lot of the same subjects that we explore in this course. You can refer to this resource for extra information on these subjects.

The [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/) book. This book aims to teach people how to program in Python. It's available online in PDF and browsable forms. Again, you can use this resource to learn more about some of the subjects we cover.

The [official language reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html). This is a technical reference of all Python language components. At first, this resource might be a little too complex, but as you learn how Python works and how it’s built, this can be a useful reference to understand the details of these interactions.
